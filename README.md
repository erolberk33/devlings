# 🌐 Web Development Project Showcase

This repository contains a curated collection of frontend and full-stack projects I’ve developed over the past few years. Each folder represents a unique web interface or functionality demo—created to practice layout design, interactivity, and component-based thinking using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some backend technologies.
